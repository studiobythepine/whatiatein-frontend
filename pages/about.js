        <p>
          My hobbies include cooking, traveling and eating... I made this site as a place to organize all of the places
          I&apos;ve vistied and the restaurants I ate at during those travels. When looking for a restaurant, I imagine
          where the locals are eating on a regular weekday dinner, as I think tht will give you the best
          value/expereince. If you love value as much as I do, I think this list will be helpful so YOU don&apos;t have
          to be the one scrolling around google maps in desparation to find a good spot to eat and annoy your S/O in the
          process.
